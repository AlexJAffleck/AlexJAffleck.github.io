									<h1>Hi, I'm<br />
									Alex Affleck</h1>
									<p> I graduated from Utah State University with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems and a concentration in Data Engineering. I am currently a Data Analyst for the Insitute for Disability Reseach, Policy, and Practice.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/me5.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p> I was born in Detroit, MI and moved to Idaho Falls when I was four. I grew up there and graduated from Hillcrest High School with honors in 2017. After high school, I served a religious mission for two years in the Philippines. Upon returning, I studied at and graduated from Utah State University. My hobbies include playing the piano, lifting weights, and cooking. </p>
								<p> I worked for nearly a year at a woodshop making window shutters. There I learned to work both independently and with a team. I then was hired as the Systems Administrator for the Shingo Institute. I administered an instance of salesforce, provided IT support, and run our data analysis project called Insight. By collecting detailed information about different organization's workplace culture and outlook, I created interactable dashboards in Tableau that helps them to find areas of improvement and opportunities for business excellence.</p>
								<p> I enjoy learning and critical thinking. I try to learn all that I can, whether I do it through googling random questions I have during the day, listening to podcasts and reading books, or as I strive to continally imrpove my data skills. I find the world of data to be fascinating - there is an overwhelming abundance of it, yet a shortage in understanding and utilization. I enjoy solving complex problems and all of the insights and findings that accompany the process. </p>
